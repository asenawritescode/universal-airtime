The Voucher code is 16 digit code.

The amount affects the positional arguments of the code.
ie. 
10 - ( 1 -> 2^1, 0 -> 2^0) 
    = 01XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

100 - ( 1 -> 2^2, 0 -> 2^1, 0 -> 2^0)
    = 00X1XXXXXXXXXXXX

1000 - ( 1 -> 2^3, 0 -> 2^2, 0 -> 2^1, 0 -> 2^0)
    = 00X0XXXXXXXXXXX0

The number's postional value is placed in the result of the power of the positional value.

We could have our first number in the middle of the code and overlaps to the first digit.
Run length encoding would be a good way to compress the code.
