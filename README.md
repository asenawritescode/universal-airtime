# Universal Airtime 4 Everyone

This is a project that we picked up after the Africa's Talking API Hackthon by Elarian, Postman and Elarian.

## Problem :
- "Lack of access to scratch cards. It is difficult to get access to shops in some remote areas in Kenya and even in areas with shops in most occasions they do not have the voucher or the denomination needed."

## Solution:
- "A voucher code that can be used on any telco in Kenya, a universal airtime or airtime for all lines"
